            <h3>Weather</h3>
            <p>
              Scotland’s weather is typically mild and unpredictable, but
              extreme conditions are rare. It’s common to feel like you've
              experienced all four seasons in a single day, and a short 20-30
              minute trip in any direction often brings a completely different
              climate! Scotland offers something special in every season, so
              there’s really no "bad" time to visit. As the old saying goes,
              “There’s no such thing as bad weather, only unsuitable clothing!”

            <h3>Culture</h3>
            <p>
              Scottish culture is deeply rooted in history and remains vibrant
              today. From ancient clans to modern festivals, each generation has
              added to Scotland’s unique identity, creating a lively mix of
              traditions like tartan, music, and dance.

            <h3>Food and Drinks</h3>
            <p>
              Scottish food is hearty and flavorful, reflecting the country’s
              history and natural resources. Traditional dishes include haggis,
              a savory mix of meat, oats, and spices, and cullen skink, a rich
              soup made with smoked haddock. Fresh seafood, like salmon and
              scallops, is widely enjoyed, thanks to Scotland's coastal waters.
              A full Scottish breakfast often includes items like black pudding
              and tattie scones, while sweet treats like shortbread and tablet
              are popular. Scotland’s whisky, famous worldwide, also plays a
              role in cooking. Today, Scottish cuisine mixes these classic
              dishes with modern twists, making it a unique and tasty experience
              for visitors.”

            <h3>People</h3>
            <p>
              Scottish people are widely recognized for their friendliness and
              kindness, traits that are deeply embedded in the culture. Whether
              in the bustling cities or the more remote, picturesque villages,
              Scots are known for their warm hospitality and willingness to
              engage with visitors. A typical greeting might involve a hearty
              “Hello” or “How’s it gaun?” (How’s it going?), often accompanied
              by a smile and a genuine interest in the well-being of others.
              Their kindness is not only evident in everyday interactions but
              also in their community spirit, where helping neighbors and
              supporting one another is a strong value. This openness and
              generosity make Scotland a welcoming place, where people feel
              instantly at home.
